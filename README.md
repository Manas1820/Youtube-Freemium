# Youtube_Freemium

## Project Goal

To make an API to fetch latest videos sorted in reverse chronological order of their publishing date-time from YouTube for a given tag/search query in a paginated response.

## Feature List:

- [X] Server should call the YouTube API continuously in background (async) with some interval (say 10 seconds) for fetching the latest videos for a predefined search query and should store the data of videos (specifically these fields - Video title, description, publishing datetime, thumbnails URLs and any other fields you require) in a database with proper indexes.
- [X] A GET API which returns the stored video data in a paginated response sorted in descending order of published datetime.
- [X] A basic search API to search the stored videos using their title and description.
- [X] Dockerize the project.
- [X] It should be scalable and optimised.
- [X] Add support for supplying multiple API keys so that if quota is exhausted on one, it automatically uses the next available key.
- [ ] Make a dashboard to view the stored videos with filters and sorting options (optional)
- [X] Optimise search api, so that it's able to search videos containing partial match for the search query in either video title or description.
    - Ex 1: A video with title *`How to make tea?`* should match for the search query `tea how`


## Reference:
- YouTube data v3 API: [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)
- Search API reference: [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list)
    - To fetch the latest videos you need to specify these: type=video, order=date, publishedAfter=<SOME_DATE_TIME>
    - Without publishedAfter, it will give you cached results which will be too old
